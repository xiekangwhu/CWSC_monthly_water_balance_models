# CWSC_gridded_based_monthly_water_balance_models

This code contains fortran code used to calibration of monthly water balance models. Water balance models can estimate daily, monthly, and annual hydrological variables and processes by considering soil moisture. 

Most monthly water balance models have the concept of a water tank model. Three monthly water balance models are selected for the Soil moisture storage capacity (SMSC) parameter, i.e., Dynamic Water Balance Model (DWBM), Snowbelt-based Water Balance Model (SWBM), and Time-variant Gain Model (TVGM).

Abstract

Catchment water storage capacity (CWSC) links the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, which is required as spatial parameters for geoscientific models. However, there are currently no available common datasets of the CWSC on a global scale, especially for hydrological models since conventional evapotranspiration-derived estimates cannot represent the extra storage capacity for the lateral flow and runoff generation. Here, we produce a dataset of the CWSC parameter for global hydrological models. Joint parameter calibration of three commonly used monthly water balance models provides the labels for a deep residual network. The global CWSC is constructed based on the deep residual network at 0.5Â° resolution by integrating 15 types of meteorological forcings, underlying surface properties, and runoff data. CWSC products are validated with the spatial distribution against root zone depth datasets and validated in the simulation efficiency on global grids and typical catchments from different climatic regions. We provide the global CWSC parameter dataset as a benchmark for geoscientific modelling by users.
